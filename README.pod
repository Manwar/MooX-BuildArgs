=head1 NAME

MooX::BuildArgs - Save instantiation arguments for later use.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Foo;
    use Moo;
    with 'MooX::BuildArgs';
    has bar => (is => 'ro');
    
    my $foo = Foo->new( bar => 32 );
    print $foo->build_args->{bar}; # 32

=head1 DESCRIPTION

It is often useful to be able to access the arguments that were
used to create an object in their unadulterated form, before any
coercions or init_args have changed them.  This L<Moo> role
provides the arguments via the L</build_args> attribute.

Note that no attempt is made to weaken the args.  So, if you use
this module and you have attributes with C<weak_ref> set the
references will not be weakened within L</build_args>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 build_args

    my $args_hashref = $object->build_args();

Returns a hashref containing the captured arguments.
